## 重要通知 Important Notice

從即日起，週日禱告會、主日學、主日敬拜改成線上 Zoom 形式
Starting from 1/9/2022, All Sunday Services Are Online-Only

由於最近疫情在 Santa Clara County 十分嚴峻，也有多位會友的家屬或同事是密接或感染COVID-19，經同工會討論決定，我們暫時停止在教會堂聚會，改為 Zoom Online，請做好相應準備。

Upon learning that some family members or co-workers of our congregation members have tested positive or in close contact with someone with COVID-19, the Congregation Committee decided that we stop all in-person services effective immediately. All Sunday Services will be held via Zoom meetings.
